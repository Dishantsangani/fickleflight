# Getting Started with Create React App

# About This Project
1.Identify relevant APIs: Search for travel discount APIs that offer programmatic access to their deals. Popular travel discount marketplaces or coupon providers might have APIs you can leverage.

2.API Integration:  Once you've identified an API, you'll need to understand its documentation and authentication process. It will typically involve making API calls from your application to retrieve discount data.

3.Data Integration: Integrate the retrieved discount data into your application. This might involve parsing the JSON response from the API and displaying it on your Homepage component. You could potentially display these discounts alongside your search results or popular destinations.

4.Display Discounts:  Design and implement a user interface element to display the discounts you've retrieved from the API. This could be a separate section on your homepage or integrated with your search results.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
